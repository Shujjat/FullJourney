First, the world ofthe extremaly lage,\nthe Universe itself, Radio telescopes now gather informaiion\n{rom the far side of the universe and have recenty detected,\n2 radio waves. the “fraight of the big bang which probably\nStarted off the expancing universe nearly 20 billion years\n‘990. Secord, the world of the extremely smal, that of tho\nParticles such as, electrons, protons, neutrons, mesons end\n‘thers. The third frontier isthe word of complex mater tis\nalso the World of "middle-sized” things, from molecules at\none extreme to the Earth at the other This is all\nundamental physics, which isthe hear of science.\n\nBut what is physics? According to one deffnion, physics\ndeals with the study of matter and energy ‘and tre\nrelationship between them. The study of physics involves\n‘investigating such things as the laws of motton. the structure\nof space and time, the nature and type of forces that nots\n\nBy the end of 19" century many physicists started belleving\nthat every thing about physics has been discovered\nHowever, about the beginning ofthe twentieth contury many\n"ew experimental facts revealed that the laws formulated by\nthe previous investigators need mocifications. Further\nresearches gave birth to many new disciplines in physics\n‘Such as nuclear physics which deals with atomic rscle,\n', 'particle physics which is concemed wit the ultimate particles\nDf wrhich the matter is composed, elavisticmechanics which\n<deals with velocities approaching that of ight and solid state\nphysics which is concerned with the structure and properties\n‘5f solids, but this ists by no means exhaustive.\n\nPhysics is most fundamental of all sciences and provides\nlther branches of science, basic principles and fundamental\nTews. This overlapping of physics and other fields gave birth\nte new branches such as physical chemistry, biophysics,\n‘astrophysies, health physics etc. Physics also plays an\nImportant role in the development of technology and\nengineering.\n\nScience and technology are @ potent force for change in\nthe outlook of mankind. The Information media and fast\n‘means of communications have brought all parts of the\n‘word in close contact with one another. Events in one part\nOf the world immediately reverberate round the globe.\n\nWe are living in the age of information technology. ‘The\n‘computer networks are products of chips developed from\nthe basic ideas of physics. The chips are made of silicon.\nSilicon can be obtained from sand. Itis upto us whether we\nmake a sandcastle or a computer out of i\n\n“The foundation of physics rests upon physical quantities in\nterme of which the laws of physics are expressed.\n“Therefore, these quantities have to be measured accurately.\n‘Among these are mass, length, time, velocity, force, density,\ntemperature, electric curren, and numerous others\n\nPhysical quantities are often dlvided into two categories:\nbase quantiies and derived quanties. Derived quantties\nfare those whose definitions are tased on other physical\n‘Quantities. Velooty, acceleration and force et. are usually\nViewed as derived quantities. Base quantiies are not\ndefined in terms of other physical quantities. The base\n‘quantities are the minimum number of those physical\nQuantities in terms of which other physical quantiles can\nbe defined. Typical examples of base quantities are length,\n‘mass and time.\n\nour :\n© to**\noe 2 Btn\nww ff some\n~ (OB.\neo iy\noe Rae oo\ner ohm sone\n', '‘The measurement ofa base quantity involves two steps: frst\nthe choice of a standard, and second, the establishment of a\n‘procedure for comparing the quantity to be measured with\n{he standard so that a number and a unit are determined as\nthe measure ofthat quantity\n\n‘An ideal standard has two principal characteristic: it is\n‘accessible anc itis invariable. These two requiremonts are\n‘often incompatible and a compromise has to be made\nbetween them.\n\n‘In 1960, an international committee agreed on a set of\ndefinitions and standard to describe’ the physical\nueniies, The system that was established Is called the\n‘System International (Si),\n\n‘There are seven base units for various physical quantties\n‘namely: length, mass, time, temperature, electric current\numinous intensity and amount of a substance (with special\n\nreference tothe number of particles)\nThe names of base units for these physical quantities\ntogether with symbols are lisied in Table 1-1. Their\n\nstandard definitions are given in tre Appendbx 1\n', 'Radian.\n‘The radian isthe plane angle between two radi of a circle\n‘which cut off on the circumference an arc, equal in length\nta the radius, as shown in Fig. 1.1 (a)\n\nSteradian\n‘The storadian is the solid angle (three-dimensional angle)\nsubtended atthe centre ofa sphere by an area of its surface\nfequal to the square of radius ofthe sphere.

For example,\n‘TUF may be written as *pF.\n\n‘A number such as 5.0 x 10* om may be expressed\nin scientific notation as 5.0 x 10° m.\n\nWhen a multiple of a base unit is raised to @ power,\nthe power applies tothe whole ‘and not the,\nbase unit alone.

The error may occur due\n{0 |) negligence or inexperience of a person (2) the faulty\n‘apparatus °) inappropriate method or technique. The\nlunceriainty may occur due to inadequacy or imitation of an\n“nstrument, natural variations of the object being measured\n‘oF natural imperfections of a person's senses, However, th\nUncertainty is also usually described as an enor in a\n‘measurement. There are two major types of errors.\n\n(0) Random error (i) Systematic error\n\nRandom error is said to occur when repeated\n‘measurements of the quantity, give different values under\n\n", 'the same conditions. itis due to some unknown causes.\nRepeating the measurement several times and taking an\naverage can reduce the’effect of random errors.\n\nSystematic error refers\'to an effect that influences all\n‘measurements of a particular quantity equally. It produces\n‘2 consistent dillerence in readings, It occurs to some\n<efinte rule. t may occur due to zero error of instruments,\npoor calibration of instruments or incorrect markings etc.\nSystematic error can be reduced by comparing the\ninstruments with another which is known to be more\n‘accurate. Thus for systematic error, a correction factor can\nbe applied.\n\n“45 SIGNIFICANTFIGURES\nmeen Spacer eereiontes\neueiaets erennns Cee\nee\nSeperate eres\npoe ee\nee\nSaker peered eee ts\ndegree of accuracy which may be achieved while\npy\nore MRR Ra ot\nefi A SR a\nsoon erpraniety aii\nPri ape einen\nie somes semana Se\ncone pete eaters\nep oe es\nSaoos\n\nBy applying the above rule the postion of the edge of a line\nrecorded as 12.7 em wit the help of a metre rod calibrated\nin mllmetes may te between 1265 om and 1275 cm.\n“Thus in this example the maximum uncertainty is 0.05 em.\nitis, fact, equivalent to an uncertainty of 0.1 em equal to\nthe least count of te instrument divided into two pats, half\n‘above and haif below the recorded reading.\n\n‘The uncertainty or accuracy in the value of a measured\n\n‘quantity can be indicated conveniently by using significant\nfigures.

While caleuating a\nresult t\n\nAll digits 1.2.3.4.5,6,7,8,9 are significant.

If the least count ofthe scale\nis 10 kg, then the number of significant figures\nwill, be_3 written in scientific notation as,\n8,00 x 10° kg and so on.\n\n4) When @ measurement is recorded in scientific\nnotation or standard form, the figures other than\nthe powers of ton are significant figures.\n\nFor example, a measurement recorded as\n8.70 x 10° kg has three significant figures.\n\nIn multiplying or dividing numbers, keep @ number\nCf significant figures in the product or quotient not\n‘more than that contained in the least accurate\n{actor Le, the factor containing the least number of\nsignificant figures.

They should be\n\ndistinguished clearly. The pfecision of a measurement =\n\ndetermined by the instrument or device being used and the\n\n‘accuracy of a measurement depends on the fractional or\n\n‘Percentage uncertainty in that measurement.\n\nFor example, when the length of an object is recorded as\n5.5m by using a metre rod having smallest division in\nmillimetre, itis the diflerence of two readings of the intial\n{and final postions. The uncertainty inthe single reading a:\nGiscussed before is taken as + 0.05 om which is now\n‘doubled and is called absolute. uncertainty equal to\n+20,1cm, Absolute uncertainty, in fac, is equal to the joast\nCount of the measuring instrument\n\nPrecision or absolute uncertainty (least count) = + 0.1 cm\n\nWw\n", 'Fracionat uncertainty = 219%. 5 0.004\nPercentage incersinty= BIE". 100” = 04%\n\n[Another measurement taken by vernier calipers with least\n‘count ae 0.01 em is recorded as 0.45 cm.

In fact, it is the\nfelative measurement which is important. The smaller a\nphysical quantty, the more precise instrument should be\nlused. Here the measurement 0.45 cm demands that @\n‘more precise instrument, such as micrometre screw\n‘gauge. with least count 0.001.cm, should have been\nUsed.

In\n‘he study of thermodynamics, usualy ideal gas_is\nconsidered as a working substance. The molecules of an\n‘deal gas are mere mess points which exert no forces on\n‘one another. So the intemal energy of an idoal gas system\n‘is generally the translational KE of its molecules. Since\nthe temperature of a system is defined as the average K =\nofits molecules, thus for an ideal gas system, the internal\n‘energy is directly proportional to its temperature.\n\n‘When wo heat a substance, energy associated with ts\n‘stome oF molecules is increased l., heat Is converted {o\nintemal energy.\n\nIts important to note that energy can be added to &\n‘system even though no heat transfer takes place. For\n‘example, when two objects are rubbed together their\nIntemal energy increases because of mechanical work\n‘The increase in temperature of the object is an indication\nof increase inthe internal energy. Similarly, when an object\nslides over any surface and comes to rest because of\nfrictional forces, the mechanical work done on or by the\n‘ystems partially converted into internal energy\n\nIn thermodynamics, intemal energy is a function of state\n‘Consequently, it does not depend on path but depends on\ninital and final states ofthe system.

By experimentit\nhhas been seen thatthe change in intemal energy is always\nthe same and is independentof paths C; and Cz as shown in\nthe Fig. 19.2\n\n“Thus internal energy is similar to the gravitational PE. So\ntke the potential energy, it isthe change in intemal energy\n{and not its absolute value, which is important.\n\n‘We know that both heat and work correspond fo transfer of\n‘energy by some means, The idea was first applied to the\nSteam engine whore & was natural to pump heat in and\n‘get work out.
